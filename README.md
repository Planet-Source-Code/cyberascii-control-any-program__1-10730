## Control Any Program


</div>

### Description

(Update: Includes Example now and a spy program to help you find out what those window classes are!) Ok, among my other codz, this one is quite fun... If you've ever made a proggie (AOL/AIM) before, you've used a bas file for it...Well, those files, beleive it or not, contain the coding in this bas in one form or another to give them access to AOL/AIM's program. All you have to do is get a program's Window Class, then call cGetWindow (TheClass) and you know have control...It's more complicated than what's stated here...Thx for downloading and vote plz...
